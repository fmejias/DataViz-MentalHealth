## Data

The data used in the project is data on mental illnesses that have affected every country in the world. The data shows the percentage of people who have suffered from Depression, Anxiety, Eating Disorders, Drug Use, Alcohol Use and Schizophrenia. In addition, data are presented that show the unemployment and suicide rates through the years for each of the countries.

The data used in the project can be found on Gist here:

## Questions

The following questions drove the interactions and visualizations implemented in the project:

- How has the percentage of mental illnesses in each country changed over time?
- What are the most common mental illnesses that have affected each country?
- Has there been a decrease in people with mental illnesses, or rather an increase?
- How has the percentage of unemployment in each country changed over time?
- Which countries have been most affected by unemployment?
- How has the rate of suicides in each country changed over time?
- Which countries have had the highest suicide rate over the years?
- Which are the countries that have been most affected by unemployment, and what is the percentage of the population that suffers from a mental illness in these countries?

## Sketches

The idea behind this sketch is to analyze how the percentage of the population that has suffered a mental illness has varied over the years.

The idea behind this sketch is to analyze which are the 5 countries that have been most affected by unemployment, and at the same time show the percentage of the population that suffers from a mental illness.

## Visualizations

### Mental Illnesses Line Chart

This visualization consists of a line chart that shows the percentage of the population that has suffered from a mental illness since the year 1990. Through this visualization, it is possible to analyze the percentage of the population that has suffered from Depression, Anxiety, Eating Disorders, Drug Use, Alcohol Use and Schizophrenia over the years. The interaction in this graph takes place through the multiple menu that allows selecting the country and the mental illness to be analyzed. 

In this case, a line chart allows me to better analyze the change in the percentage of the population over the years, and allows me to answer questions such as:
- How has the percentage of mental diseases in each country changed over time?
- Has there been a decrease in people with mental illnesses, or rather an increase?

### Mental Illnesses and Unemployment Line Chart

This visualization consists of another line chart that shows both the percentage of the population that has suffered from unemployment and the percentage of the population that has suffered from a mental illness over the years. The interaction in this graph takes place through the menu that allows selecting the country to be analyzed. 

In this case, a line chart allows me to better analyze the change in the percentage of the population over the years, and allows me to answer questions such as:
- Which are the countries that have been most affected by unemployment, and what is the percentage of the population that suffers from a mental illness in these countries?
- Has there been a decrease in people with mental illnesses, or rather an increase?

### Mental Illnesses and Unemployment Bar Chart

This visualization consists of a bar chart that shows the 5 countries that have been most affected by unemployment, and at the same time show the percentage of the population that suffers from a mental illness. The interaction in this graph takes place through the menu that allows selecting the year to be analyzed. 

In this case, a bar chart allows me to better compare this data, and allows me to answer questions such as:
- Which countries have been most affected by unemployment?
- Which are the countries that have been most affected by unemployment, and what is the percentage of the population that suffers from a mental illness in these countries?

### Mental Illness Choropleth Map with linked line Chart

This visualizations shows how the percentage of the world population that suffers from a mental illness has varied over the years. The interaction in this graph will take place through the linked line chart.

In this case, a Choropleth map allows me to better analyze the change in the percentage of the world population over the years, and allows me to answer questions such as:
- How has the percentage of mental diseases in each country changed over time?
- Has there been a decrease in people with mental illnesses, or rather an increase?

### Suicides Line Chart

This visualization consists of a line chart that shows the share of deaths from suicides in the world over the years. The interaction in this graph takes place through the menu that allows selecting the year to be analyzed. 

In this case, a line chart allows me to better analyze the change in the share of deaths from suicide over the years, and allows me to answer questions such as:
- How has the rate of suicides in each country changed over time?
- Which countries have had the highest suicide rate over the years?

### Project Dashboard - Mental Illnesses, Unemployment and Suicides over the years

This dashboard consists of multiple views to analyze which are the 5 countries that have been most affected by unemployment, and at the same time analyze how the percentage of the population that has suffered a mental illness has varied over the years. The interaction in this visualizations takes place through the menu that allows selecting the year to be analyzed.

In this case, the multiple views allows me to answer questions such as:
- How has the percentage of mental diseases in each country changed over time?
- Has there been a decrease in people with mental illnesses, or rather an increase?
- Which countries have been most affected by unemployment?
- Which are the countries that have been most affected by unemployment, and what is the percentage of the population that suffers from a mental illness in these countries?

## Future Work

- For the Choropleth Map, it is expected to add the option to show the percentage of the population when clicking on a country.
