# Mental Health Data Visualization Project
Dynamic and static visualizations for Mental Health datasets.

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is data on mental illnesses that have affected every country in the world. These data show the percentage of people who have suffered from Depression, Anxiety, Eating Disorders, Drug Use, Alcohol Use and Schizophrenia. In addition, data are presented that show the unemployment and suicide rates through the years for each of the countries.

The data to be used for the project can be found on Gist here:

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept for this data by making three visualization prototypes.

The first visualization prototype consists of a line chart that shows the percentage of the population that has suffered from a mental illness since the year 2000.

The second visualization prototype consists of another line chart that shows the percentage of the population that has suffered from unemployment since the year 2000.

The third visualization prototype consists of bar chart that shows the percentage of the population in some American countries that suffered Schizoprenia in the years 1995, 2005 and 2015.

## Questions & Tasks

The following questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

- How has the percentage of mental diseases in each country changed over time?
- What are the most common mental illnesses that have affected each country?
- Has there been a decrease in people with mental illnesses, or rather an increase?
- How has the percentage of unemployment in each country changed over time?
- Which countries have been most affected by unemployment?
- How has the rate of suicides in each country changed over time?
- Which countries have had the highest suicide rate over the years?
- Is there any correlation between unemployment and suicide?
- Which are the countries that have been most affected by unemployment, and what is the percentage of the population that suffers from a mental illness in these countries.
- Is there a relation between suicide and mental illness?

## Sketches

The idea behind this sketch is to analyze how the percentage of the population that suffers from a mental illness has varied over the years. In this case, a line chart allows me to better analyze the change in the percentage of the population over the years, and allows me to answer questions such as:
- How has the percentage of mental diseases in each country changed over time?
- Has there been a decrease in people with mental illnesses, or rather an increase?

The idea behind this sketch is to analyze which are the 5 countries that have been most affected by unemployment, and at the same time show the percentage of the population that suffers from a mental illness. In this case, a bar chart allows me to better compare this data, and allows me to answer questions such as:
- Which countries have been most affected by unemployment?
- Which are the countries that have been most affected by unemployment, and what is the percentage of the population that suffers from a mental illness in these countries.

## Open Questions

My idea behind making these visualizations, and choosing this type of dataset, is because I am currently carrying out a project on Sentiment Analysis, and I would like to focus it later on analyzing social networks to discover information about different mental illnesses. Once I have this data, I would like to be able to combine it with the current data from the dataset, and thus be able to compare it and analyze it. For example, I would like to analyze the percentage of mental illnesses that were reported in a specific year, and then analyze all the data that occurred on social media about mental illnesses that year. Perhaps those comparisons or visualizations allow people to find a pattern, a topic, or some issue that has not been taken into account, and can help people who suffer from mental illness. I still don't know how I am going to combine this, but I hope to find a way to do it.
