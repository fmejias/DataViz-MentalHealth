This visualization was constructed using D3 & React.

The idea behind this multiple views is to analyze which are the 5 countries that have been most affected by unemployment, and at the same time analyze how the percentage of the population that has suffered a mental illness has varied over the years.

# Questions I wanted to answer with this visualization

- How has the percentage of mental diseases in each country changed over time?
- Has there been a decrease in people with mental illnesses, or rather an increase?
- Which countries have been most affected by unemployment?
- Which are the countries that have been most affected by unemployment, and what is the percentage of the population that suffers from a mental illness in these countries?
