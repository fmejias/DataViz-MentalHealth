This visualization was constructed using D3 & React.

The idea behind this visualization was to show the percentage of deaths by suicide in some countries over the years.

# Questions I wanted to answer with this visualization

- How has the rate of suicides in each country changed over time?
- Which countries have had the highest suicide rate over the years?

The data used in this visualization can be found on Gist here:
