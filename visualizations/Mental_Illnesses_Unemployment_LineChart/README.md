This visualization was constructed using D3 & React.

The idea behind this visualization was to show the percentage of the world population othat suffer from some mental illness over the years.

# Questions I wanted to answer with this visualization

- How has the percentage of mental diseases in some countries changed over time?
- Has there been a decrease in people with mental illnesses, or rather an increase?

The data used in this visualization can be found on Gist here:
