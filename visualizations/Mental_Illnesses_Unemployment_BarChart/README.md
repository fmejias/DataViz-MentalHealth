This visualization was constructed using D3 & React.

The idea behind this visualization is to analyze which are the 5 countries that have been most affected by unemployment, and at the same time show the percentage of the population that suffers from a mental illness. In this case, a bar chart allows me to better compare this data, and allows me to answer questions such as:

# Questions I wanted to answer with this visualization

- Which countries have been most affected by unemployment?
- Which are the countries that have been most affected by unemployment, and what is the percentage of the population that suffers from a mental illness in these countries?

The data used in this visualization can be found on Gist here:
