This visualization was constructed using D3 & React.

The idea behind this visualization is to analyze how the percentage of the world population that suffers from a mental illness has varied over the years. In this case, a Choropleth map allows me to better analyze the change in the percentage of the world population over the years, and allows me to answer questions such as:

# Questions I wanted to answer with this visualization

- How has the percentage of mental diseases in each country changed over time?
- Has there been a decrease in people with mental illnesses, or rather an increase?

The data used in this visualization can be found here:

- [Mental Healths Disorders Dataset](https://gist.github.com/fmejias/8df2a27f1285576ae3cf4d67c3368144)
- Country boundaries from [World Atlas TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/world-atlas), polished for visual style, including graticules.
