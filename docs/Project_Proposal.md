# Mental Health Data Visualization Project
Dynamic and static visualizations for Mental Health datasets.

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is data on mental illnesses that have affected every country in the world. These data show the percentage of people who have suffered from Depression, Anxiety, Eating Disorders, Drug Use, Alcohol Use and Schizophrenia. In addition, data are presented that show the unemployment and suicide rates through the years for each of the countries.

The data to be used for the project can be found on Gist here: 
[Mental Healths Disorders Dataset](https://gist.github.com/fmejias/8df2a27f1285576ae3cf4d67c3368144)

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept for this data by making three visualization prototypes.

The first visualization prototype consists of a line chart that shows the percentage of the population that has suffered from a mental illness since the year 1990. Through this visualization, it will be possible to analyze the percentage of the population that has suffered a mental illness over the years, and the percentage of the population that has been unemployed over the years. In addition, a line will be added that shows unemployment through the years for the country that is selected through the menu. The interaction in this graph will take place through the multiple menu that allows selecting the country and the mental illness to be analyzed.

The second visualization prototype consists of another line chart that shows the percentage of the population that has suffered from unemployment since the year 2000. The idea is to be able to unite this prototype with the previous prototype to show unemployment and the percentage of people who have suffered from a mental illness in a specific country on the same graph.

The third visualization prototype consists of bar chart that shows the percentage of the population in some American countries that suffered Schizoprenia in the years 1995, 2005 and 2015.

## Questions & Tasks

The following questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

- How has the percentage of mental diseases in each country changed over time?
- What are the most common mental illnesses that have affected each country?
- Has there been a decrease in people with mental illnesses, or rather an increase?
- How has the percentage of unemployment in each country changed over time?
- Which countries have been most affected by unemployment?
- How has the rate of suicides in each country changed over time?
- Which countries have had the highest suicide rate over the years?
- Which are the countries that have been most affected by unemployment, and what is the percentage of the population that suffers from a mental illness in these countries?

## Sketches

The idea behind this sketch is to analyze how the percentage of the population that has suffered a mental illness has varied over the years. In this case, a line chart allows me to better analyze the change in the percentage of the population over the years, and allows me to answer questions such as:
- How has the percentage of mental diseases in each country changed over time?
- Has there been a decrease in people with mental illnesses, or rather an increase?

The interaction in this graph will take place through a menu that allows selecting the country and the mental illness to be analyzed.

The idea behind this sketch is to analyze which are the 5 countries that have been most affected by unemployment, and at the same time show the percentage of the population that suffers from a mental illness. In this case, a bar chart allows me to better compare this data, and allows me to answer questions such as:
- Which countries have been most affected by unemployment?
- Which are the countries that have been most affected by unemployment, and what is the percentage of the population that suffers from a mental illness in these countries?

The interaction in this graph will take place through the menu that allows selecting the year to be analyzed.

The idea behind this sketch is to analyze how the percentage of the world population that suffers from a mental illness has varied over the years. In this case, a Choropleth map allows me to better analyze the change in the percentage of the world population over the years, and allows me to answer questions such as:
- How has the percentage of mental diseases in each country changed over time?
- Has there been a decrease in people with mental illnesses, or rather an increase?

The interaction in this graph will take place through the linked line chart. In addition, it is expected to add the option to show the percentage of the population when clicking on a country.

By October 25, the three desired visualizations are already implemented, and this week the Choropleth Map was modified to link it with a Line Chart using React. In addition, a Dashboard was created with visualizations on mental illnesses, unemployment and suicide over the years. The Vizhub project of the Choropleth Map is the following:
